Can you find answer(s) in the sentence?

### Overview
We want to teach the computer to understand human language. 
To do this, we need your help to provide answers to a question in a given sentence.

### Process
You will be presented with a sentence and a question. 
Your task is to provide answer(s) to the question using words in the sentence. 
The question asks for information about a verb (target phrase) in the sentence such as who/what/where/when. 
The target phrase is highlighted to make your work easier. 
For example, given the sentence "Pat <mark>built</mark> a robot" 
and the question "Who <mark>built</mark> something?", your job is to:

* <b>Step 1:</b> Decide if the answer can be found in the sentence. If not, choose the reason why it can't be found.
* <b>Step 2:</b> If the answer can be found in the sentence, answer that question using only words from the original sentence.  For example, "Pat". When there is more than one correct answer, try to list them all.


### Tips
<h4 style="color:#8cc63e;"><strong>Do This</strong></h4>
* Try to provide all the correct answers.
* Please read the examples carefully, pay attention to the <b>correct answer(s)</b> and <b>typical wrong answer(s)</b>.
* Some questions might be slightly ungrammatical or have the wrong tense, please try your best to provide answers as long as you can understand them.
* Trust your understanding of the language!


<h4 style="color:#f05921;"><strong>Do Not</strong></h4>
* Do not use words NOT in the original sentence for answer.
* Do not change the tense/spelling of the words in the original sentence for answer.

### Examples
Here are some examples that can help you better understand the task.

#### Example 1

<table>
<tr><th> Sentence                  </th> <td> Pat's plan of building intelligent robots is <mark>supported</mark> by the company . </td></tr>
<tr><th> Question                  </th> <td> What is <mark>supported</mark> ?                                                     </td></tr>
<tr><th> Correct Answer(s)         </th> <td> Pat's plan of building intelligent robots <br> Pat's plan <br> plan                  </td></tr>
<tr><th> Typical Wrong Answer(s)   </th> <td> Pat <br> robots                                                                      </td></tr>

#### Example 3

<table>
<tr><th> Sentence                  </th> <td> The U.S. interest rate is expected to <mark>decline</mark>, dragging dollars down to around 1.80 marks . </td></tr>

<tr><th> Correct Answer(s)         </th> <td> <i>The answer(s) cannot be found because the required information is not provided in the sentence.</i>   </td></tr>
<tr><th> Typical Wrong Answer(s)   </th> <td> 1.80 marks                                                                                               </td></tr>
